-- Setup --

When you want to make a new post, simply place either a html or markdown file in docs/.  Files without a .html or .md ending will not be processed; files with a .md ending will be processed with markdown before being published.

Tip: name your files based on the date like so yyyymmdd, this way mBlog will display the most recent post first.

-- How it works --

index.php lists all of the files in $directory, sorts them and then prints them.  For example, if you have the following files in your directory; "1.html, 2.html, 3.html"

Your website would be shown like this:

<3.html>
<2.html>
<1.html>


-- Directories --

You can add directories to docs/, and have post files there.  mBlog will automatically generate a menu for you to get to the other directories.
