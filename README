-- Setup --

Create a directory somewhere on your server where you want to have your blog files, then set $directory in index.php to that directory.  When you want to make a new post, simply place either a html or php file in that directory.  Files with a .html ending will not be processed, files with a .md ending will be processed with markdown before being published.

-- How it works --

index.php lists all of the files in $directory, sorts them and then prints them.  For example, if you have the following files in your directory; "a.html, b.html, c.html"

Your website would be shown like this:

<title>
<c.html>
<b.html>
<a.html>
